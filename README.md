### The Real Mr. Spock, lost on earth and data science for space

- 👋 I'm the real Mr. Spock and I crashed here on Earth. I no longer have contact with my crew. That's why I'm looking for earthlings who can build a spaceship and want to travel with me back to my home planet Vulcan. Importantly, we need enough space in the starship for a sustainable organic coffee and sugar beet plantation, as well as space for cows to be kept in a species-appropriate manner. So there is room for everything to produce good coffee! Afterwards we can continue exploring the universe together on space missions!
- 👀 I’m interested in data science and web development.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning English for nerds and human being, HTML and CSS, PHP, JavaScript, Python, R, Git and GitHub, statistics, data analysis and data visualization.
- 💞️ I'm looking for people who prefer logic with irony and sophisticated humor to emotion. Emotionality is fascinating and I understand it as a human characteristic, but personally I have no understanding of it.
- 📫 How to reach me: contact information later.
